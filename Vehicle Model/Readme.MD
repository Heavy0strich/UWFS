## Wheel Model

The most important point for the creation of a simulation model is to calculate the forces generated at the contact patch. Wheel Model derives these forces.

To calculate these values, the model takes wheel slip, tire side slip angle and friction coefficients. Let's see how the individual inputs are derived.

### 1.  Wheel Slip:
To calculate wheel slip, it is necessary to define individual wheel velocities.





### 2. Tire Side Slip Angle
To calculate Tire side slip angle, wheel caster has to be known
